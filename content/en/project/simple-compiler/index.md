title: Simple Compiler
summary: 
  Developed a simple compiler (still has 15,000 lines) that translates C language files into Intermediate Representation (IR) and MIPS32 assembly. The compiler supports essential features such as I/O operations, control flow and function calls. It includes comprehensive lexical, syntax, and semantic analysis, along with informative error messages.
