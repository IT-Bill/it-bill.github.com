I'm on an exciting journey at Southern University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://sustech.edu.cn"><strong>SUSTech</strong></a>), 
diving deep into Computer Science and Technology.
I've got a passion for mixing up <strong>Software Engineering with Artificial Intelligence</strong>.
<br>Dreaming big here, but I'm all about crafting a piece of software that the whole world will want to use someday. 
No solid plans on what it'll be just yet, but I'm stoked about the endless possibilities.
